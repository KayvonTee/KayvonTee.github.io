About this page:


In the past I've tried journaling as a means of reflection, but I would never stick to it. I would also never look back at my previous entries, making it an ineffective practice for me. I am creating this page in the hopes that sharing my thoughts, experiences, and a little about myself here will solve these issues. 


Maybe you will learn about me on a personal level from what I share on this page. This isn't my intention with this page, however. A saying that my parents would tell me -- and I also believe from my own experience -- , is that traveling or spending money with someone else is how you learn who someone is at their core. In no way does sharing here follow this. You are not getting to know me by just reading the text I write on a digital screen.


Instead, I hope that through writing entries here in a more formal format than a journal, my content becomes more relevant and sticks with me. It would also be a bonus if others reading what I share found this meaningful for themselves.


Guess what? After I write that this page isn't for people to learn who I am, I'm going to introduce myself (It wouldn't make sense if I didn't share some basic information about myself!)... My name is Kayvon and at the time of writing this, I am a junior in college studying engineering. I enjoy playing tennis, biking, cooking, and hiking/being outdoors. Whether you know me in real-life (which if you found this page... is concerning lol), or happen to stumble into this page, I hope you find the writings I share valuable and/or thought provoking. 


This page will be a work in progress, and I'm sure as I add more entries, the content I write will become more clear. I am being open and honest about myself and my thoughts. I hope by reading this page, there is some takeaway from what I share. If one day you find yourself in a situation and remember reading about this dude who went through something similar, and that memory brings you a smile, I think that would be pretty cool, and enough of a reason for me to continue sharing.
